# Text-Editor
A single-page text editor app using PWA

## Description
This is a text editor web application developed as a single-page application (SPA) that meets the criteria of a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It features offline functionality, data persistence using IndexedDB, and is bundled with webpack. The service worker caching is implemented using Workbox, ensuring a smooth offline experience for users.


## Installation
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  First, `run npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4.  After installation, run `npm run build` to build the application.
5.  Finally, run `npm run start:dev` to start the development server.

Here's a breakdown of the commands:

*   `npm install`: This command installs all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.
*   `npm run build`: This command triggers the build process for the client-side code using webpack.
*   `npm run start:dev`: This command concurrently starts the development servers for both the client and server. It uses `concurrently` to run multiple npm scripts simultaneously.
